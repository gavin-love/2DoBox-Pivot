# 2DoBox-Pivot
For this project, we inherited someoneâ€™s previous IdeaBox project and pivoted it over to a 2DoBox. Our task was to evolve, refactor, and clean up the code we inherited. This includes deleting redundant, broken, or obsolete code. However, we could not throw out the previous work wholesale.
Furthermore, there could be no reduction in functionality except when explicitly called for by new requirements.
